# N-Emojis-Problem

It is a fun game in which, you have NxN Board where you are allowed to put emojis on board according to your choice and, using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) the same type of emojis will not be adjacent to each other. Now the code support for 2,3,4, values of N, For higher values of N it takes much time because the whole search space or all the nodes of the tree will be traversed in the worst case for achieving the goal state using BFS or DFS.

# Dependencies

As the BFS and DFS are heuristic search algorithm, we need only **copy & emojis** python library.

# How to execute the code :

1. You will first have to download the repository and then extract the contents into a folder.
2. Make sure you have the correct version of Python installed on your machine. This code runs on Python 3.6 above.
3. You can open the folder and run following on command prompt.

`python color_emoji_BFS.py` or `python color_emoji_DFS.py`
